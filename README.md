Built on Node.js, Picto uses websockets (and ws.js on the server) to facilitate real time communication between clients.

**Picto is optimised for mobile screens.** Desktop optimisation.. soonâ„¢

## Drawing
Using a mouse or finger, drawing is handled by Paper.js. Future updates will remove the need for the overhead of paper.js and will interact with the canvas directly in js to improve performance.

Pixels are encoded in a base-64 like fashion for transmission and could theoretically support end-to-end encryption.
